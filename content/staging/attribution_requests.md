# Attribution Requests for Practitioner Interviews

## AI Agents Research Publishing Project

---

## Overview

This document tracks permission requests for practitioners whose quotes and insights will be attributed in the **Practitioner Perspectives** blog series (Publications 14-18). Per the publishing specification (Section 9), explicit permission must be obtained before publishing posts that feature named practitioners.

**Important**: Until permission is received, posts can be drafted but should use anonymized attribution (e.g., "an enterprise AI deployment expert" or "a practitioner we spoke with").

## Quotes Planned for Use

### 1. an enterprise AI deployment expert - Publication 14

**Publication Title**: "Inside an AI agent orchestration company: Why 90% of Enterprise AI Agent Pilots Never Convert to Production"

**Quotes to be attributed**:

> "Most AI agent deployments fail due to undefined ROI calculations and lack of commercial mindset, not technical limitations."

> "90% of all the pilots just doesn't work or stop just stop at the pilot's base and never convert into production. So there is friction. And enterprise adoption is in low single digit across the industry."

> "A lot of the time, so a lot of people think oh AI has to be like 7, 80%, 90% is about prompt engineering and about training the AI workforce, actual coding, about where to call API to get intelligence. So that's only around 40% of the work. 40 to 50% of the world, max. The rest of the time I spent on system system integration."

> "The intelligence is really smart enough right. So so it doesn't doesn't need the model to be much better to make this work in enterprise. So the the real sticking point is system integration which has to do with all this you know system that doesn't have never talked to each other. SAP and Salesforce has never talked to each other."

### 2. a founder at an AI infrastructure company - Publication 15

**Publication Title**: "an AI infrastructure company's Take: Managing Expectations with Probabilistic Systems"

**Quotes to be attributed**:

> "Me demoing, I know that I just got lucky. Maybe 1 in 70 out of 100 runs of this demo, I will get lucky so I can run it, right? And when it fails, I will chuckle and go, whatever. So you can get away with it. If it works 70% of the time, you can demo it. Now, the other person on the other end, they are not used to that probabilistic nature. So they assume, oh my God, this works, I'm going to ship it."

> "Most people that have built and deployed technology over the last, say, 30 years aren't used to probabilistic stochastic systems. They're used to deterministic things. So the expectation is if I see it working once, I expect it to work reliably from that point on."

> "That's where the skill problem really starts to kind of hurt is because most people aren't used to how to make that better. They kind of go into this like doom loop almost... They'll go, oh, I see, okay, this scenario didn't work. I'll go change the prompt and the instructions and the data or whatever to make this scenario work. But then they go, oh, but the other one stopped working and they're now in this continuous loop."

> "Most people building this super lightweight three tier web apps and now they have to run a system that learns for a long time, has long lived state, can have buffer problems, can have communication channel problems with bi directional communication."

---

### 3. an engineering leader at a major identity company - Publication 16

**Publication Title**: "How a major enterprise identity company is Solving AI Agent Identity: The Next SSO Moment"

**Quotes to be attributed**:

> "All of these pricing like changes or type of pricing schemes is confusing to large enterprises. What we were told is they don't know how many tokens they're going to use for cross app access... Those are things that is confusing internally to us, to a major enterprise identity company, but also confusing to enterprise because they're not used to that. They can't model their usage, they can't model their outcome."

> "Our team in India as a target of 50 integrations they can build with the Windserve... We're 3X... So it's not like we're cutting off or laying off anybody. We're just saying well now we can do 150 integrations."

> "MCP just merged the a major enterprise identity company Cross app access extension to be the repo to be in the GitHub... It should be launched around Thanksgiving time I assume. I expect azurebit to make a pretty big deal of extensions and we're the first one on identity security on that."

> "If you look at the voice conversation, especially, there are there is nothing out of the box that I can quickly integrate and get started with... the amount of capabilities or abilities an agent need to reach a call center represented in Manila or in India or in like Brazil are way more right now three to five times more cost than hiring a human like customer service representative."

### 4. a co-founder at a multi-agent framework company - Publication 17

**Publication Title**: "a multi-agent framework company's Lesson: Why Enterprise Topology Complexity Is Your Moat"

**Quotes to be attributed**:

> "The hardest part of agent deployment isn't the AI itself but navigating 40-country presence, 100,000+ employees, multiple acquired companies with different tech stacks (HubSpot vs. Salesforce), and varied legislation. This operational knowledge creates defensibility that can't be solved by throwing money at the problem."

> "There are literally companies that are coming to us and they're like, we're loving what we're doing, we'll try to do more and we're going to choose one of our locations to really double down on agents... we're going to do Canada first... I was like, no, let's do South Korea because we're opening an office there... they're like, no, Canada the easier labor laws."

---

### 5. an AI lead at a sales intelligence company - Publication 18

**Publication Title**: "an AI sales intelligence company's Approach: Building AI Sales Agents That Actually Work"

**Quotes to be attributed**:

> "Almost never do we evaluate something end to end because it is pointless. So if you can evaluate a system at a time, and that is how you grow better... we built it blind after step one... the only thing that we continuously tested for is that it gets the first step right. The first step typically ends up being retrieval. If it gets the first step right, if it has the right data at that point in time, everything after that will work."

> "We cannot be super heavy on the last mile prompting... For any specific company you would typically have like 60 million data points. For any specific deal you would have at least like 500, 600k data points."

> "For any specific company you would typically have like 60 million data points. For any specific deal you would have at least like 500, 600k data points. And using all of this you're supposed to... a lot of the AI and the agents that we use are in service of figuring out how to make these 600k data points go to like the 20 data points that are actually relevant to answering that question."

> "You shouldn't use LLM to judge something which as a human, you find extremely hard to judge. Like, it's a recipe for disaster. It will be inconsistent."

Dear [Practitioner Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding our conversation from earlier this year as part of my Stanford GSB research project on AI agent deployment.

I'm now preparing a series of blog posts for my personal website (fernandotorres.io) based on the research findings from 36 expert interviews, 5 industry conferences, and 3 functional prototypes. As someone who provided particularly valuable insights, I would like to feature your perspectives in a dedicated blog post.

**The Publication:**

- Title: "[Publication Title]"
- Focus: [Brief description of the post's focus]
- Platform: Personal blog at fernandotorres.io
- Estimated publication: [Month 2025]

**Quotes I Would Like to Attribute to You:**

[Insert specific quotes from the relevant practitioner section above]

**My Request:**
I am seeking your permission to:

1. Attribute these quotes to you by name (first name) and company ([Company Name])
2. Include the context of your role and company focus in the post
3. Publish this on my personal blog

**If you prefer:**

- I can use only your first name without company affiliation
- I can anonymize the attribution entirely (e.g., "a practitioner at a leading [industry] company")
- I can modify or remove any specific quotes

Please let me know if you're comfortable with the attribution as described, or if you'd prefer any modifications. I'm happy to share the draft post with you before publication for your review.

Thank you for your contributions to this research. Your insights have been invaluable in understanding the realities of AI agent deployment in production environments.

Best regards,
