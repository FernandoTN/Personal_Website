## Title

"What Actually Makes AI Agents Work in Production"

## Subtitle

"The Architecture vs. Model Contribution Breakdown"

---

## Key Data Points to Visualize

### Primary Split

- **30-40% Model Capability** (Intelligence Layer)
- **60-70% System Architecture** (Engineering Layer)

### Source Validation

- **18/26 sources** (69%) confirmed this finding independently
- Data synthesized from 36 interviews, 5 conferences, 3 prototypes

### Supporting Statistics (Secondary)

- 92% of sources cited system integration as dominant challenge
- 40-50% of deployment time spent on integration alone
- 80-90% framework abandonment rate in production
- 90% enterprise pilot failure rate

---

## Visual Concept: Stacked Block Architecture

### Chosen Approach: **Inverted Pyramid / Foundation Blocks**

A vertical stacked block visualization that shows:

1. **Top Block (30-40%)**: "Model Capability" - Smaller, visually representing the AI/LLM contribution
2. **Bottom Foundation (60-70%)**: "System Architecture" - Larger base blocks representing the engineering foundation

### Why This Concept Works:

- **Architectural metaphor**: Reinforces that AI agents are "built" systems, not just AI
- **Counter-intuitive visual**: The AI portion being smaller creates immediate cognitive impact
- **Foundation emphasis**: The larger base communicates that architecture is literally the foundation of success
- **Stanford GSB compatible**: Clean, professional, data-forward

### Block Sub-Components (within 60-70% section):

**System Architecture Foundation Blocks:**
| Component | Visual Weight | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Integration | ~25% | Connectors, APIs, MCP, enterprise system orchestration |
| Evaluation Infrastructure | ~20% | Testing, observability, debugging, monitoring |
| Context Management | ~15% | Memory, RAG, context windows, data pipelines |
| Orchestration Framework | ~10% | State machines, workflow coordination, error handling |

## Elements to Include

### Primary Visual

- Large stacked blocks with percentage labels

- Subtle architectural/engineering visual cues (blueprint lines, grid pattern)

### Quote Callout (from an AI autonomous agent company Fireside Conference)

> "We found out actually model only maybe contributes 30 or 40% of the whole thing. And the framework, the whole system you build upon the model is much more important than the model itself."

### Data Validation Badge

- Small badge or annotation: "Validated across 18 of 26 independent sources"
- Credibility indicator showing research rigor

### Key Insight Callout

- Text box: "Production AI agents are an engineering problem, not an AI problem."

### Source Attribution

## Research Context for Designer

### The Insight Explained

Before this research, the common assumption was that AI model capability (better GPT versions, larger context windows, improved reasoning) was the primary driver of agent success - perhaps 70-80% of the equation.

The research discovered the opposite: **system architecture, integration, and evaluation infrastructure contribute 60-70% to production success**, while the AI model itself contributes only 30-40%.

This finding challenges the industry narrative that "better models will solve agent deployment problems" and redirects attention to engineering excellence as the critical success factor.

### Why This Matters

- Investors should evaluate agent companies on engineering capability, not model access
- Teams should allocate resources to integration and evaluation, not just prompt engineering
- The demo-to-production gap is primarily an engineering challenge, not a capability limitation
