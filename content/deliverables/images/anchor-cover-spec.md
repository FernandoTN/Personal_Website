## Publication

- Title: What's Really Blocking AI Agents from Production? Insights from 36 Expert Interviews
- Type: Anchor/Overview Publication
- Context: Stanford GSB GSBGEN 390 Individual Research, Autumn 2024

## Image Concept

**"The Iceberg of AI Agent Deployment"**

A modern, minimalist visualization showing an iceberg where the visible tip (30-40%) represents "AI Models" while the massive underwater portion (60-70%) represents the true complexity: architecture, integration, evaluation, and business case clarity. This directly reflects the research's core finding that model capabilities are only 30-40% of success, while framework engineering and integration drive the remaining 60-70%.

The iceberg metaphor powerfully communicates that what most people focus on (model capabilities) is only the visible surface, while the real work happens beneath—in the engineering infrastructure that makes agents production-ready.

## Key Visual Elements

- **Iceberg Structure**: Clean geometric iceberg with clear waterline division
- **Above Water (30-40%)**: Labeled "Models" - smaller, visible portion with a subtle AI/neural network pattern
- **Below Water (60-70%)**: Labeled sections for "Architecture," "Integration," "Evaluation," and "Business Case" - larger, more complex portion
- **Percentage Indicators**: Subtle "30-40%" above water and "60-70%" below water annotations
- **Waterline**: A distinct horizontal line representing the gap between perception and reality
- **Data Points**: Small visual elements suggesting the 36 interviews, 5 conferences, 3 prototypes (optional)

## Color Palette

- Primary: Deep Navy Blue (#1a365d) - representing depth, professionalism, and the "hidden" infrastructure
- Secondary: Ice Blue/Cyan (#63b3ed) - representing the visible AI/model layer
- Accent: Warm Orange (#ed8936) - highlighting key statistics or the waterline division
- Background: Gradient from light sky blue above water to deep ocean blue below
- Text: White (#ffffff) for labels against dark backgrounds, Navy for light areas

## Text Overlay

- Title text: None on image (title will be in blog header)
- Tagline (optional): "90% of pilots fail. Here's what the 10% get right."
- Key stat callout (optional): "30-40% Model | 60-70% Engineering"

## Dimensions

- Blog: 1200x630px (primary)
- LinkedIn: 1200x627px
- Twitter: 1200x675px
- Aspect Ratio: ~1.91:1 (works across all platforms)

## Style Notes

- Modern, professional aesthetic with clean lines
- Minimal, geometric design language
- Subtle gradients rather than flat colors
- Clean sans-serif typography (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- AI/tech aesthetic achieved through structure and color, not cliche circuit patterns or robot imagery
- Research-backed credibility through clean data visualization style
- Avoid: Robots, humanoid AI imagery, overly complex neural network visuals, glowing effects

## Composition Guidelines

- Iceberg positioned slightly left of center for visual interest
- Negative space on right side can accommodate text overlays if needed
- Waterline should be positioned at approximately 1/3 from top (golden ratio)
- Below-water section should feel substantial and detailed
- Above-water section should feel simpler, almost deceptively simple

## Alternative Concepts

### Concept B: "The 90/10 Gap"

A visual bridge or canyon showing the gap between "Pilot" (90% fail) on one side and "Production" (10% succeed) on the other, with the bridge built from engineering foundations (architecture, integration, evaluation) rather than AI model blocks.

### Concept C: "The Inverted Pyramid"

An inverted pyramid where the small top point is labeled "Models" and the wide base (supported by multiple pillars) represents Architecture, Integration, Evaluation, and Business Case—showing what actually holds up production AI agents.
