## Title

**"Why 90% of Enterprise AI Agent Pilots Fail"**

Subtitle: _"The blockers aren't technical — they're organizational, economic, and regulatory"_

---

## Key Data Points

### Primary Statistics

- **90%** enterprise pilot failure rate (McKinsey/Bain research via the practitioner, an AI agent orchestration company)
- **95%** POC-to-production failure rate (a multi-agent framework company, Project Nanda)
- **Single-digit** enterprise adoption rates across the industry
- **89%** of research sources (24 of 27) explicitly reference enterprise blockers
- **3-5x** cost disadvantage for generic agent tasks vs. offshore human labor

### The Five Enterprise Blockers (Non-Technical)

| Blocker                   | Key Insight                                                                           | Source Quote                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security & Compliance** | Trust deficit in regulated industries (BFSI, healthcare) prevents cloud LLM adoption  | "There is a lot of resistance in sharing data with agentic systems... a lot of trust deficit" — an engineering leader at a workforce platform             |
| **Identity Management**   | Agents need distinct identities from users (virtual employees) but no standards exist | "AI agents may be present... They have their own identity that the tools can access every system" — a practitioner at an AI infrastructure company        |
| **Pricing Confusion**     | Multiple competing models (seat/token/outcome) prevent cost forecasting               | "Those pricing schemes are confusing... They can't model their usage, they can't model their outcome" — an engineering leader at a major identity company |
| **Human-in-the-Loop**     | HITL requirements must be architectural, not procedural                               | "You have to trust the LLM to make decisions on your behalf... a people and processes issue" — a practitioner                                             |
| **Business Case Unclear** | ROI justification is #1 blocker before any technical issues                           | "90% of all pilots don't work or stop at pilot stage... never convert into production" — an enterprise AI deployment expert                               |

### Supporting Data

- **40%** revenue forecast miss (even Anthropic's FP&A head missed projections)
- **30 years** of deterministic software created expectation mismatch with probabilistic systems
- **$400-750/month** enterprise willingness-to-pay vs. **$20/month** current offerings
- **5-8 week** deployment timelines (50% business alignment, 50% technical)

---

## Visual Concept

### Primary Visualization: "The Governance Gauntlet"

A **horizontal pipeline/gauntlet visualization** showing AI agent pilots entering from the left and being eliminated by successive blockers before reaching "Production" on the right.

**Layout Structure:**

```
[100 PILOTS] --> [BLOCKER 1] --> [BLOCKER 2] --> [BLOCKER 3] --> [BLOCKER 4] --> [BLOCKER 5] --> [10 SURVIVORS]
   START          Security        Identity       Pricing          HITL         Business       PRODUCTION
                                                                               Case
```

**Visual Metaphor:**

- Pilots represented as small agent icons flowing through a funnel/pipeline
- Each blocker is a "gate" or "barrier wall" that filters out agents
- Numbers decrease dramatically at each stage
- Color intensifies from green (start) to red (blockers) to gold (production success)

### Alternative Visualization: "The Iceberg"

Above waterline (visible): **Technical Capability** (10% of the challenge)
Below waterline (hidden): **Governance Blockers** (90% of the challenge)

- Security & Compliance
- Identity Management
- Pricing/Economics
- Human-in-the-Loop
- Organizational Change

This emphasizes the finding: _"Enterprise adoption is governance-constrained, not technology-constrained"_

## Style Notes

### Tone & Messaging

- **Urgent but not alarmist**: Present data as actionable insight, not doom
- **Enterprise-appropriate**: Professional aesthetic suitable for C-suite audiences
- **Evidence-based**: All statistics sourced from research, not hyperbole
- **Solution-oriented**: Implication is that these blockers are addressable

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness**: Data should be immediately comprehensible
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Eye should flow from 90% stat down through blockers
3. **White space**: Avoid cluttered enterprise-style density
4. **Professional gravitas**: This is research, not marketing clickbait

### Accessibility Considerations

- High contrast text (4.5:1 minimum)
- Icons paired with text labels (not icon-only)
- Alt text for all visual elements
- Color not sole indicator of meaning

### Do NOT Include

- Excessive jargon or acronyms without definition
- More than 5 key statistics (cognitive overload)
- Vendor-specific branding or logos
- Speculative claims without research backing

---

## Source Attribution

### Primary Data Sources

- an enterprise AI deployment expert: 90% pilot failure rate, McKinsey/Bain research
- a multi-agent framework company (the co-founder): 95% POC failure rate
- an engineering leader at a major identity company: Pricing confusion, identity challenges
- an engineering leader at a workforce platform: Trust deficit in regulated industries
- a practitioner: Human-in-the-loop requirements

### Research Basis

- **Total Sources**: 27 (17 interviews + 5 conferences + 3 prototypes + 2 summaries)
- **Sources citing blockers**: 24 of 27 (89%)
- **Research Period**: Autumn 2025
- **Institution**: Stanford GSB (GSBGEN 390)

## Implementation Notes

### For Designer

1. Start with the 90% statistic as the visual anchor
2. Build the pipeline/gauntlet as the central narrative device
3. Use the 5-blocker framework as information architecture
4. Ensure the quote callout stands out as the key takeaway

### File Naming Convention

- `infographic-enterprise-blockers-social.png` (1200x630)
- `infographic-enterprise-blockers-square.png` (1080x1080)

### Delivery Format
