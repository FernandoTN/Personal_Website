## Key Messages for Outreach

### Elevator Pitch

"Research from 36 expert interviews reveals why 90% of AI agent pilots fail to reach production. The surprising finding: it's not the models - system integration accounts for 40-50% of deployment effort, yet gets 10% of the attention."

### Key Stats to Lead With

- 90% of AI agent pilots never convert to production
- 92% of practitioners cite system integration as the primary challenge
- 80-90% abandon frameworks like a popular AI agent framework for production
- Models contribute only 30-40% to successful deployments

### Unique Value Proposition

"First practitioner-focused research on production AI agents, not lab benchmarks. Real failure patterns from teams actually shipping agent systems."
