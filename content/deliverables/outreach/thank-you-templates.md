## Personalized Email Drafts

### Draft 1: an enterprise AI deployment expert

**Subject:** Thank you - AI Agents Research Published

Dear the practitioner,

I wanted to reach out to thank you for your time and insights during our AI Agents research project at Stanford GSB.

Your perspectives on enterprise AI agent deployment challenges - particularly the insight that business case failure is the primary failure mode rather than technical limitations - were invaluable and fundamentally reframed our research direction.

We've now published our research as a series of blog posts. Your insights are featured prominently in "Inside an AI agent orchestration company: Why 90% of Enterprise AI Agent Pilots Never Convert to Production."

Key findings that your input helped surface:

- ROI calculation gaps as the #1 blocker for enterprise AI adoption
- System integration consuming 40-50% of deployment effort
- The 5-8 week deployment timeline reality

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the findings further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Fernando Torres & Shekhar Bhende
Stanford GSB MSx '26

### Draft 2: a founder at an AI infrastructure company

**Subject:** Thank you - AI Agents Research Published

Dear the founder,

I wanted to reach out to thank you for your time and insights during our AI Agents research project at Stanford GSB.

Your framework for understanding the probabilistic vs deterministic systems gap - and the concept of the "doom loop" that teams fall into when productionizing agents - became one of the anchor concepts in our research findings.

We've now published our research as a series of blog posts. Your insights are featured in "an AI infrastructure company's Take: Managing Expectations with Probabilistic Systems."

Key findings that your input helped surface:

- The 70% demo threshold and expectation mismatch it creates
- 30 years of deterministic software conditioning as a barrier
- Scientific method approach for improving probabilistic systems

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the findings further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Fernando Torres & Shekhar Bhende

### Draft 3: an engineering leader at a major identity company

**Subject:** Thank you - AI Agents Research Published

Dear the engineering leader,

I wanted to reach out to thank you for your time and insights during our AI Agents research project at Stanford GSB.

Your perspectives on enterprise identity challenges for AI agents - and the insight that CISOs/CIOs serve as gatekeepers blocking adoption - provided crucial context for understanding enterprise blockers beyond technical limitations.

We've now published our research as a series of blog posts. Your insights are featured in "How a major enterprise identity company is Solving AI Agent Identity: The Next SSO Moment."

Key findings that your input helped surface:

- Agent identity as the "next SSO moment" for enterprise
- MCP Cross App Access extension as first enterprise security standard
- 3x coding productivity gains vs 3-5x cost disadvantage for generic tasks

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the findings further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Fernando Torres & Shekhar Bhende

### Draft 4: a co-founder at a multi-agent framework company

**Subject:** Thank you - AI Agents Research Published

Dear the co-founder,

I wanted to reach out to thank you for your time and insights during our AI Agents research project at Stanford GSB.

Your insight that enterprise topology complexity creates defensible competitive advantage - rather than being merely an obstacle - fundamentally shifted how we framed the integration challenge in our research.

We've now published our research as a series of blog posts. Your insights are featured in "a multi-agent framework company's Lesson: Why Enterprise Topology Complexity Is Your Moat."

Key findings that your input helped surface:

- Operational knowledge as a moat that money cannot replicate
- Labor law considerations driving geographic deployment decisions
- $2M single use case savings with $100M 2026 targets as ROI benchmarks

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the findings further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,

### Draft 5: an AI lead at a sales intelligence company

**Subject:** Thank you - AI Agents Research Published

Dear the AI lead,

I wanted to reach out to thank you for your time and insights during our AI Agents research project at Stanford GSB.

Your "build blind after step one" evaluation philosophy - focusing on component-level testing of retrieval rather than end-to-end evaluation - was a counterintuitive insight that challenged conventional testing wisdom and resonated strongly with our findings.

We've now published our research as a series of blog posts. Your insights are featured in "an AI sales intelligence company's Approach: Building AI Sales Agents That Actually Work."

Key findings that your input helped surface:

- Context (not generation) as the competitive moat for vertical AI
- 60M data points per company reduced to 20 relevant points as the core challenge
- Component-level evaluation over end-to-end testing

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the findings further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Fernando Torres & Shekhar Bhende
