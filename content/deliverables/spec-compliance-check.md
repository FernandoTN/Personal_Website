| `website-env-check.md`         | Website environment check              |

**Total Extra Deliverables**: 18 supplementary files

## Gaps Identified

### 1. Image Assets (Partial Compliance)

**Spec Requirement**: Cover images for all posts in `publishing/deliverables/images/`
**Current Status**: The `/images/` folder contains 6 specification/design documents for images, but no actual PNG/JPG image files.

**Files Present**:

- `anchor-cover-spec.md` - Design specification for anchor post cover
- `theme-covers-spec.md` - Design specifications for 6 theme covers
- `infographic-70-30-spec.md` - Infographic design spec
- `infographic-enterprise-blockers-spec.md` - Infographic design spec
- `infographic-framework-spec.md` - Infographic design spec
- `infographic-metrics-spec.md` - Infographic design spec

**Impact**: Blog posts reference `/images/blog/*.png` paths but actual image files need to be created based on specs.
**Recommendation**: Create actual image files from the detailed specifications provided.

### 2. Quote Attribution Minor Issues

**Per validation-quotes.md findings**:

- 3 quotes identified as paraphrased rather than verbatim
- 1 attribution error (a popular AI agent framework quote attributed to Cynthia but spoken by Fernando)

**Impact**: Minor - does not affect overall content quality
**Recommendation**: Review and correct as noted in validation-quotes.md

### 3. Website Integration Not Executed

**Spec Requirement (Section 9)**: Copy files to website, run build, test URLs
**Current Status**: Files prepared but not yet deployed to website at `/Users/fernandotn/Projects/FernandoTorresWebsite/`

**Impact**: Expected - website integration is a separate deployment step
**Recommendation**: Follow `website-copy-instructions.md` for deployment
