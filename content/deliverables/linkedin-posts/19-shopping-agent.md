## Post Content

We switched frameworks mid-prototype. Under deadline pressure. During SF Tech Week.

And we're not alone.

80-90% of teams abandon frameworks like a popular AI agent framework for production deployments. We experienced it firsthand while building a shopping agent for e-commerce automation.

We started with LangGraph. The abstraction looked clean. The documentation promised simplicity.

Within days, we hit a wall: extensive bloat and complexity that slowed us down instead of speeding us up.

Here's what building a shopping agent taught us:

- We abandoned LangGraph for a popular AI agent framework mid-development due to framework bloat
- Time pressure amplifies framework issues - abstractions work for exploration, not deadlines
- Multi-platform integration (eBay, Shopify, BigCommerce) required polyglot architecture (Python + Node.js) - no single framework solved it
- We mocked MCP rather than implementing it - the protocol isn't production-ready

The uncomfortable truth: the same tools that help you demo in a week can block you when you need real results.

Our framework switch validated what 36 expert interviews told us: models contribute only 30-40% to agent success. The framework and architecture matter more.

## Publishing Notes

- Replace [LINK] with: https://fernandotorres.io/blog/shopping-agent-framework-bloat
- Post timing recommendation: 9-11am PST on Tuesday-Thursday
- Consider adding cover image showing architecture or framework comparison
- GitHub link included for credibility and technical audience engagement
- Strong appeal to developers, engineering managers, and AI practitioners who have faced similar framework decisions
- First-person narrative creates authenticity and differentiates from observational research
