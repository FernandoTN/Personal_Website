# LinkedIn Post: Publication 8 - Model Myth

---

Everyone's waiting for GPT-5. They're missing the point.

After interviewing 36 experts building production AI agents, we uncovered a finding that inverts the industry narrative entirely.

The model is not your bottleneck.

According to the an AI autonomous agent company co-founder: "The model only contributes 30-40% of the whole thing. The framework, the whole system you build upon the model is much more important."

Here's what the research shows:

- Model only contributes 30-40% to agent success (an AI autonomous agent company Fireside)
- Framework and architecture account for 60-70% of outcomes
- 40-50% of deployment time is spent on system integration
- Waiting for better models won't fix bad architecture

The AI industry is pouring billions into model improvements. Meanwhile, teams with solid architecture are shipping production agents with current models.

The gap between demo and deployment isn't intelligence. It's engineering.

Do you think AI progress is model-limited or engineering-limited?
