## Post Content

Most AI memory vendors are solving two problems as if they were one.

That's why their solutions fail.

After interviewing 36 experts building production AI agents, we uncovered a distinction that's being overlooked: user memory and agent memory are fundamentally different architectural problems.

User memory stores preferences, history, and PII for personalization.
Agent memory stores tool patterns and problem-solving strategies for optimization.

One serves end users. The other serves engineering teams.

Here's what we discovered:

- Different stakeholders: users want personalization; engineers want performance metrics
- Different governance: user memory requires PII compliance; agent memory needs engineering access
- Different update cycles: user memory requires real-time updates; agent memory can be batch-processed
- Conflating them creates systems that fail both use cases

As one practitioner put it: "Memory as Two Distinct Problems... Most vendors conflate these."

Teams building unified memory systems are building something that handles nothing well.

How do you handle memory architecture in your AI systems? Have you separated user and agent memory?
