# LinkedIn Post: Publication 3 - Context Management

---

Gemini has 1 million tokens. Claude has 200K. Does it matter?

Not the way you think.

After researching 36 expert interviews on production AI agents, I found something counterintuitive:

Context capacity is a marketing metric.
Context quality is what actually matters.

We call it the 40% Rule.

When you push context utilization beyond 40%, response quality starts to degrade. More context does not mean better answers. It often means worse ones.

Here's what the research revealed:

- 40% utilization is the quality cliff - push beyond and watch accuracy drop
- Context engineering > context capacity - how you structure beats how much you can fit
- User memory and agent memory are different problems - conflating them kills performance
- Compression beats expansion - one team reduced 60M data points to 20 for better results

The teams winning at context management aren't chasing bigger windows.

They're building smarter retrieval, better compression, and strategic memory architectures.
