## Post Content

Agent identity is the next SSO moment.

Every enterprise that wants AI agents accessing their systems faces a fundamental question: how do you authenticate a non-human actor across dozens of applications?

I spoke with an engineering leader at a major identity company at a major enterprise identity company, who leads the AI/agent identity initiatives and has conducted 300+ customer calls about agent deployment challenges.

His key insight: "MCP just merged the a major enterprise identity company Cross App Access extension... we're the first one on identity security on that."

This matters because CISOs and CIOs are the real gatekeepers blocking enterprise AI agent adoption.

Here's what a major enterprise identity company's enterprise conversations reveal:

- CISO/CIO approval is required before agents can access enterprise systems - no exceptions
- MCP extensions are emerging as the first enterprise-grade identity standard for agent protocols
- Pricing confusion compounds adoption friction - enterprises "can't model their usage, can't model their outcome"
- Coding agents deliver 3x productivity gains while generic agents cost 3-5x more than human labor

The uncomfortable truth: the authentication infrastructure for agents barely exists. The enterprises figuring out agent identity and governance now will have a significant head start in the agentic AI era.

How is your organization thinking about authenticating and authorizing AI agents? Is identity the blocker no one's talking about?
