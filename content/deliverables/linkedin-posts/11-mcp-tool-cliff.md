MCP was supposed to be the USB for AI agents.

It promised universal integration. The industry embraced it. Developers built ecosystems around it.

But here's what nobody's publicly discussing:

Beyond 25 tools, MCP accuracy drops to just 30%.

After interviewing 36 experts building production AI agents, we found a critical limitation that renders enterprise deployments unusable at the scale they need most.

Here's what the research revealed:

- 25-tool threshold causes catastrophic accuracy degradation
- 30% accuracy means 7 out of 10 tool selections are wrong
- Enterprise scenarios routinely exceed 25 tools (CRM, ERP, ticketing, email, APIs...)
- Context bloat from tool definitions violates the 40% utilization rule

As CC Fan from an AI infrastructure company put it: "When you have more than 25 MCP tools, accuracy will drop to 30%. That's totally cannot use in production for enterprise usage."

The gap between protocol promise and deployment reality demands mitigation strategies, not blind faith in standardization.
