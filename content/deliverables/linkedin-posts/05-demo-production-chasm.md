# LinkedIn Post: Publication 5 - Demo to Production Chasm (Probabilistic Systems)

---

Your AI agent demos at 70% accuracy. Stakeholders are excited. Then production happens.

Here's the uncomfortable truth most teams discover too late:

30 years of deterministic software created false expectations for AI systems. Stakeholders expect the same predictability from probabilistic models that they got from traditional code.

They don't understand that 70% demo accuracy isn't a starting point to build from.

It's a trap.

The doom loop begins: You fix one failure scenario. Three others break. You patch those. New edge cases emerge. Your evaluation suite grows endlessly while production readiness stays out of reach.

Here's what our research found across 36 expert interviews:

- 70% demo accuracy creates false expectations with stakeholders
- 90% of AI pilots fail to reach production deployment
- Fixing one scenario breaks another (the doom loop)
- State machines provide deterministic governance over probabilistic behavior

The teams that escape this cycle architect for uncertainty from day one. They wrap probabilistic AI in deterministic control structures, not the other way around.
