## Post Content

90% of enterprise AI agent pilots never make it to production.

The surprising part? It's not a technology problem.

I spoke with the practitioner, Chief of Staff at an AI agent orchestration company, who has deployed 25+ AI agent use cases in production across financial services, insurance, and healthcare.

His key insight challenged everything I thought I knew about AI agent deployment:

"Most AI agent deployments fail due to undefined ROI calculations and lack of commercial mindset, not technical limitations."

The models work. The demos impress. But the business case falls apart.

Here's what 25+ production deployments revealed:

- 90% of pilots fail because organizations ask "can we?" before "should we?"
- 40-50% of deployment time is spent on system integration, not AI work
- GPT-4 level models are already sufficient for most knowledge work automation
- Every deployment is fully custom - no standardized product works across enterprises

The uncomfortable truth: organizations are solving the wrong problem. They're optimizing prompts while the ROI calculation is negative from day one.

What's been your experience deploying AI agents in the enterprise? Has the business case or the technology been the bigger hurdle?
