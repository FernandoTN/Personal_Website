"The model only contributes 30-40% of the whole thing."

This single sentence from the an AI autonomous agent company co-founder inverted everything I thought I knew about AI agents.

After 10 months building one of the most successful AI agent products, they discovered the industry's core assumption is backwards. We're all obsessing over model capability while ignoring what actually matters.

> "The framework, the whole system you build upon the model is much more important than the model itself."

Here's what an AI autonomous agent company learned in production:

- Models contribute only 30-40% to agent success
- Framework architecture accounts for the remaining 60-70%
- Multi-model orchestration (Gemini for search, GPT-4 for code, Claude for formatting) outperforms single-model approaches
- 8x cost reduction achieved through architectural optimization, not cheaper APIs

The competitive moat isn't model access. It's the engineering that wraps around the models.

Are you investing more in model selection or framework architecture?
