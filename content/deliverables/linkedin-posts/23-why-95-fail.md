95% of agentic AI projects fail.

Not from lack of talent. Not from bad models. From falling into the same four traps over and over again.

I just published key takeaways from a conference that brought together founders and engineers who have watched this pattern repeat. They identified exactly where teams go wrong.

The four traps killing AI agent projects:

- Trap 1: Building RAG chatbots that talk but never act - employees still handle the last mile
- Trap 2: Drag-and-drop platforms that accelerate demos but create lock-in and block production
- Trap 3: MCP context bloat - accuracy drops to 30% beyond 25 tools, costs spiral
- Trap 4: Tech debt accumulation - every model update breaks tightly coupled agents

But here's the real insight: the metric that separates winners from the 95%.

> "The real question is does it actually reduce the handoff to humans."

Handoff rate - the percentage of tasks passed back to humans - is the only metric that matters. If it's not dropping, your AI isn't transforming anything.

What's your team's handoff rate? Is it actually improving?
