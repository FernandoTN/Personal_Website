## Post Content

92% of AI agent deployments struggle with the same problem.

And it's not what you think.

After interviewing 36 experts building production AI agents, we found the #1 challenge isn't model capability or context windows.

It's system integration.

Here's what the data shows:

- 40-50% of deployment time is spent on integration (not AI work)
- MCP accuracy drops to 30% beyond 25 tools
- Custom integration is treated as competitive moat, not problem to solve
- SAP, Salesforce, core banking systems "never talked to each other"

The bottleneck isn't AI intelligence—it's the mundane work of connecting heterogeneous enterprise systems.
