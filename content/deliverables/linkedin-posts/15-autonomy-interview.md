# LinkedIn Post: Publication 15 - an AI infrastructure company Interview

---

Your AI agent worked perfectly in the demo. Your team is thrilled. Then reality hits.

Here's what 30 years of deterministic software conditioning didn't prepare you for:

When a founder at an AI infrastructure company (Founder/CEO of an AI infrastructure company) showed us his demo, he knew something stakeholders didn't: "70 out of 100 runs of this demo, I will get lucky. The other person on the other end, they assume, oh my God, this works, I'm going to ship it."

That 70% demo success rate? It's not a floor to build from.

It's where the doom loop begins.

Teams fix one failing scenario, break three others. They patch those, new edge cases emerge. Without proper evaluation frameworks, this cycle continues indefinitely.

Here's what the founder's experience at an AI infrastructure company reveals:

- 70% accuracy is demo-able but creates false stakeholder expectations
- Most engineers have 30 years of deterministic conditioning working against them
- The "doom loop" traps teams in endless prompt fixes that break other scenarios
- Scientific methodology (controlled experiments, error categorization, evals) breaks the cycle

The solution? Borrow from science, not software engineering. Set up controls. Categorize errors. Build evaluation suites that prevent regression as you progress.

What approaches have you used to manage stakeholder expectations with probabilistic AI systems?
