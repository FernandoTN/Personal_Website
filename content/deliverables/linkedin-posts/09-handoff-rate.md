## Post Content

Your AI agent achieves 95% accuracy. Response time is under 200ms. Token costs are optimized to the penny.

And your team still spends most of their day doing the same work they did before.

We've been measuring the wrong things.

After 36 expert interviews and 5 industry conferences, one metric emerged that actually matters: handoff rate. It's simple: what percentage of tasks does your agent pass back to humans?

Here's what we discovered:

- 90% of enterprise AI pilots never reach production due to misaligned metrics
- High accuracy means nothing if 80% of tasks still need human completion
- Most "AI agents" are really "smart FAQs" that answer but never act
- Handoff rate is the meta-metric that reveals if accuracy, latency, and cost improvements actually deliver value

The chatbot that knows everything but does nothing is not automation. It's a sophisticated layer of indirection before the same person does the same job.
