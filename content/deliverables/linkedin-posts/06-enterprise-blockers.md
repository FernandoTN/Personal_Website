90% of AI agent pilots fail. Not because the technology doesn't work.

Here's the uncomfortable truth from interviewing 36 AI practitioners:

Business case failure precedes technical failure. Every time.

The #1 killer? Undefined ROI calculations.

Teams are building impressive demos while executives ask: "What problem does this actually solve?"

Economics before engineering. This is the order that matters.

Here's what our research uncovered:

- 90% of pilots fail due to undefined ROI, not technical issues (the practitioner, an AI agent orchestration company)
- Pricing confusion reigns: token-based vs seat-based vs outcome-based (the engineering leader, a major enterprise identity company)
- Willingness to pay is $400-750/month, but sustainable pricing is $20/month (an engineering leader, a workforce platform)
- CISOs and CIOs are the real gatekeepers, not engineering teams

The pattern is clear: teams that nail the commercial case first have a dramatically higher success rate.

Security sign-off. Identity management. Change management. These aren't afterthoughts - they're prerequisites.
