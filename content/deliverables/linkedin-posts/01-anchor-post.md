90% of AI agent pilots fail to reach production.

We interviewed 36 experts to find out why.

After 10 weeks of research at Stanford GSB—36 interviews, 5 industry conferences, and 3 functional prototypes—we found the answer.

And it's not what you'd expect.

The model is not the bottleneck.

Models contribute only 30-40% to agent success.
The other 60-70%? Framework architecture, system integration, and business case clarity.

Here's what the data reveals:

- 30-40% model contribution vs 60-70% framework/architecture importance
- 90% of pilots fail due to undefined ROI—not technical limitations
- 80-90% of production teams abandon a popular AI agent framework for custom solutions
- 40-50% of deployment time is spent on integration work, not AI development

The companies succeeding with AI agents aren't chasing better models.

They're building better systems.
