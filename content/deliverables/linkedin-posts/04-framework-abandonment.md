a popular AI agent framework raised $25M. 80-90% of production teams abandon it. What's going on?

After interviewing 36 experts building production AI agents, we uncovered a pattern no one talks about:

Frameworks that accelerate prototyping become obstacles in production.

The same tools that help you demo in a week can slow you down 3-4x when you need real performance. Teams hit a wall and face a brutal choice: rebuild or accept the limitations.

Here's what we discovered:

- 80-90% of teams abandon frameworks like a popular AI agent framework for production deployments
- Custom frameworks run 3-4x faster than a popular AI agent framework equivalents
- We switched frameworks mid-prototype under deadline pressure (and we're not alone)
- Models contribute only 30-40% to agent success - the framework matters more

The billion-dollar framework valuations don't match the production reality.
