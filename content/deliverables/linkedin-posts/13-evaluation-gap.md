7 YC companies building AI agent evaluation tools. Zero meaningful adoption. Even among their own cohort.

When the tight-knit YC mafia refuses to use tools built by their own batch-mates, something fundamental is broken about how we approach agent evaluation.

After 36 expert interviews and 5 conferences researching AI agents, we found the disconnect: teams are measuring process metrics when outcomes matter.

Here's what we discovered:

- Current eval tools measure prompt quality, token efficiency, and retrieval relevance
- Business value comes from outcomes: meetings booked, tasks completed, handoffs reduced
- LLM-as-judge fails because GPT-5 evaluating Claude 4.5 has minimal capability gap
- Successful teams test deterministic components (retrieval), not entire probabilistic pipelines

As one founder told us: "Agent evals are very hard to measure because what you want to evaluate is actually a final outcome... Your eval for success is, did I get 10 meetings with these people?"

This is a $10B+ market opportunity waiting for whoever solves it correctly.
