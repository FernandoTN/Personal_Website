Vertical AI is winning. Here's why.

While most teams chase horizontal platforms and general-purpose agents, an AI sales intelligence company built production AI sales agents before ChatGPT even existed.

I spoke with the AI lead from an AI sales intelligence company about how they power 12-14 features from a single unified AI pipeline. Her approach to data and evaluation contradicts most conventional wisdom.

The key insight that changed my thinking:

"Almost never do we evaluate something end to end because it is pointless... we built it blind after step one. The only thing that we continuously tested for is that it gets the first step right."

Their data architecture tells the story: 60M data points per company compress down to 20 relevant data points to answer any question. Getting retrieval right means everything else follows.

Here's what building vertical AI agents taught them:

- Component-level evaluation beats end-to-end testing for production reliability
- Context retrieval is the competitive moat, not generation quality
- LLM-generated knowledge graphs create "humongous giant messes" in production - use structured graphs with defined schemas instead
- The human judgment test: only use LLM-as-judge for tasks where humans reliably agree

The uncomfortable truth: most teams are testing the wrong thing. If you nail first-step retrieval, generation "just magically works."

How does your team approach evaluation for AI agents - end-to-end testing or component-level? Has the vertical vs horizontal debate shaped your product strategy?
