## Post Content

44 sources. 38 documents. 35 parallel AI agents. 2 hours.

This is how we systematically analyzed months of research to answer one question: What's actually blocking AI agents from production?

Our Stanford GSB research project faced a challenge every researcher knows: how do you synthesize 36 interviews, 5 conferences, and 3 prototypes without losing critical nuance?

We built a two-phase extraction and aggregation methodology:

**Phase 1: Individual Extraction**

- Each source processed by a dedicated sub-agent
- Standardized template: 5+ key concepts, 3-5 critical quotes, theme tags
- Relevance scoring with written justification
- Parallel processing in batches of 5

**Phase 2: Aggregation & Synthesis**

- Theme frequency analysis across all 26 extractions
- 6 theme consolidation documents synthesizing patterns
- Evolution narrative tracking how understanding shifted
- Explicit contradiction documentation (no forced consensus)

The result? Patterns that would have been impossible to see through ad-hoc analysis.

Our core finding emerged not from any single interview, but from quantitative pattern analysis: "Production AI agents are 30-40% model capability and 60-70% system architecture."

92% of sources referenced system integration. This wasn't intuition. It was methodology.
