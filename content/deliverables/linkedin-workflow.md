## Posting Best Practices

### Timing

1. Post during business hours (Tue-Thu optimal)
2. Best posting windows: 8-10am PST or 9-11am PST
3. Avoid posting on weekends or late evenings
4. Don't post more than once per day

### Engagement

1. Respond to comments within 24 hours (first 60 minutes is optimal for algorithm)
2. Cross-reference related posts in comments when relevant
3. Tag relevant experts or companies when appropriate
4. Pin high-engagement comments to boost visibility

### Content Standards

1. Keep posts under 3,000 characters (all posts are pre-verified)
2. Include exactly 5 hashtags per post
3. End each post with an engagement question
4. Use data-driven hooks (statistics, numbers, counterintuitive findings)

### Primary Hashtags

All posts should include these 5 core hashtags:

- #AIAgents
- #EnterpriseAI
- #LLMs
- #TechLeadership
- #ProductionAI

Topic-specific hashtags can replace one or two when relevant (e.g., #SystemIntegration, #RAG, #Frameworks).

## Emergency Protocol

If a post receives negative reception:

### Immediate Response (Within 1 Hour)

1. Assess the nature of criticism (valid concern vs. troll vs. misunderstanding)
2. Do NOT delete the post unless factually incorrect or potentially harmful
3. Respond professionally and acknowledge valid concerns
4. Tag co-author for coordinated response if needed

### Valid Criticism Response

1. Thank commenter for feedback
2. Clarify any misunderstandings with data citations
3. Acknowledge limitations of research where appropriate
4. Offer to discuss further via DM if complex

### Factual Error Response

1. Edit post immediately to correct error (LinkedIn allows 24hr edit)
2. Add transparent correction note at bottom
3. Reply to comments acknowledging the correction
4. Document error for future content review

### Escalation Triggers

Contact communications support if:

- Post receives 10+ negative comments in first hour
- A verified/influential account publicly criticizes the research
- Legal or compliance concerns are raised
- Accusations of data misrepresentation

### Post-Incident Review

1. Document what happened and response taken
2. Review if content adjustments needed for related posts
3. Update workflow if process improvement identified
