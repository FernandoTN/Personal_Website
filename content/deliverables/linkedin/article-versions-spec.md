**2. Hook Paragraph:**
After spending 10 weeks at Stanford GSB interviewing 36 experts, attending 5 industry conferences, and building 3 functional prototypes, I discovered something that contradicts the dominant AI narrative: the model is not the bottleneck. In fact, models contribute only 30-40% to AI agent success. The real challenges lie in the 60-70% that everyone ignores.

**3. Key Findings (Expanded):**

- The 30-40% Model Revelation
  - Quote from an AI autonomous agent company Co-Founder
  - Why current models are already sufficient
  - Where competitive moats actually come from
- Business Case Failure Precedes Technical Failure
  - 90% pilot failure rate context
  - ROI definition challenges
  - Pricing model chaos ($20-30/month vs $5/task costs)
- The Framework Abandonment Pattern
  - 80-90% abandonment rate
  - Performance gaps (3-4x custom vs a popular AI agent framework)
  - Shopping Agent prototype validation

**4. Data Visualization Recommendations:**

- Pie chart: 30-40% model vs 60-70% framework/architecture
- Bar chart: Theme frequency analysis (System Integration 92%, Framework 85%, Model 62%)
- Table: Key statistics summary with sources
- Infographic: The research methodology (36 interviews, 5 conferences, 3 prototypes)

**5. Call to Action:**
"What has been your experience with AI agent deployment? Have you found the model to be the bottleneck, or does this research match your reality? Share your perspective in the comments, and follow me for more insights from this research series."

a popular AI agent framework is worth $1.3 billion. It powers thousands of agent prototypes. Yet when I asked production teams about their framework choices, the same pattern emerged: they started with a popular AI agent framework, built impressive demos, and then quietly rebuilt everything from scratch. This is the framework paradox nobody talks about publicly.

**3. Key Findings (Expanded):**

- The Abandonment Pattern
  - a consulting firm practitioner quote on 80-90%
  - Prototype-to-production trajectory
  - The abstraction trap mechanism
- The Performance Gap
  - a practitioner at a CRM AI company 3-4x performance difference
