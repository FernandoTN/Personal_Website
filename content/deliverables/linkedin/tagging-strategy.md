## Tagging Principles

### Core Guidelines

1. **Only tag when genuinely relevant** - The person/company must be directly mentioned or quoted
2. **Don't over-tag** - Maximum 1-2 tags per post
3. **Tag interviewees with permission** - All practitioner interview posts require explicit consent
4. **Tag companies mentioned positively** - Only when the mention adds value to them
5. **Avoid attention-seeking tags** - Never tag just for visibility boost

### Tagging Etiquette

- Always ensure context is positive or neutral
- Respect privacy preferences when communicated
- Don't tag competitors in comparison posts
- Avoid tagging during controversial discussions

## Post-Specific Tagging Plan

### Practitioner Interview Posts (14-18)

These posts feature direct quotes and insights from industry practitioners. Tagging is highly relevant but requires permission.

- Ensure the tagged party would want to be associated with the content
- Use tagging to give credit where credit is due
- Tag the correct official company page (verify handle)
- Consider timezone of tagged party for visibility

### Don'ts

- Don't tag for attention or algorithm manipulation
- Don't tag multiple people from the same company
- Don't tag without reading the full post for context
- Don't tag in controversial or debate-heavy threads
- Don't tag on posts where engagement has gone negative

### Privacy Considerations

- Respect "do not tag" preferences
- Remove tags if requested
