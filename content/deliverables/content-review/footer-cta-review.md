### Notes:

- - 2025-12-repo-patcher.mdx uses `/blog/ai-agents-research-overview` instead of `/blog/ai-agents-research`
- \*\* 2025-12-research-methodology.mdx has "Fernando Torres & Shekhar Bhende" as co-authors
- \*\*\* 2025-12-research-methodology.mdx has a different footer style (academic-style notation without standard CTA/research link format)

## Footer Consistency Summary

| Element       | Posts with Element | Percentage |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Author info   | 25/25              | 100%       |
| Research link | 24/25              | 96%        |
| Related posts | 0/25               | 0%         |
| CTA           | 24/25              | 96%        |

## Standard Footer Format (23/25 posts follow exactly):

```markdown
---

_This post is part of my research series on AI Agent deployment, based on 36 expert interviews, 5 industry conferences, and 3 functional prototypes. [Read the full research overview](/blog/ai-agents-research)._

_Have thoughts on AI agent deployment? Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandotn/) or [email me](mailto:fertorresnavarrete@gmail.com)._
```

## Variations Found:

### 1. 2025-12-repo-patcher.mdx

Uses slightly different research overview URL:

```markdown
[Read the full research overview](/blog/ai-agents-research-overview)
```

vs. standard:

```markdown
[Read the full research overview](/blog/ai-agents-research)
```

### 2. 2025-12-research-methodology.mdx

Has completely different footer format:

```markdown
---

_This methodology documentation supports the GSBGEN 390 research project on AI agent deployment, conducted Autumn 2025 at Stanford Graduate School of Business._
```

Missing: Research series link, LinkedIn/email CTAs

### 3. 2025-12-practitioner-interview-1.mdx

Has additional note after standard footer:

```markdown
---

_Note: Interview conducted with the practitioner at an AI agent orchestration company - used with permission pending_
```

(This is additive, not replacing the standard footer)

## Standardization Recommendations

### Critical Issues (2 posts):

1. **2025-12-repo-patcher.mdx**: Update research link URL from `/blog/ai-agents-research-overview` to `/blog/ai-agents-research` for consistency with other 23 posts.

2. **2025-12-research-methodology.mdx**: Add standard footer format. Replace current academic footer with:

   ```markdown
   ---

   _This post is part of my research series on AI Agent deployment, based on 36 expert interviews, 5 industry conferences, and 3 functional prototypes. [Read the full research overview](/blog/ai-agents-research)._

   _Have thoughts on AI agent deployment? Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandotn/) or [email me](mailto:fertorresnavarrete@gmail.com)._

   _This methodology documentation supports the GSBGEN 390 research project on AI agent deployment, conducted Autumn 2025 at Stanford Graduate School of Business._
   ```

### Optional Enhancement (All 25 posts):

Consider adding **Related Posts** section to improve cross-linking within the series. Example format:

```markdown
**Related Posts:**

- [The 40% Rule: Why Larger Context Windows Won't Save Your AI Agent](/blog/2025-12-40-percent-context-rule)
- [The Framework Paradox: Why 80-90% of Teams Abandon a popular AI agent framework](/blog/2025-12-framework-abandonment)
```

This would increase discoverability and engagement within the series.

## CTA Effectiveness Assessment

### Current CTA Pattern:

All 24 posts with CTAs use identical format:

- LinkedIn connection: `[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandotn/)`
- Email contact: `[email me](mailto:fertorresnavarrete@gmail.com)`

### CTA Strengths:

1. **Consistency** - Readers know what to expect
2. **Multiple channels** - Both social and direct email options
3. **Personal connection** - Invites dialogue rather than passive consumption
4. **Non-intrusive** - Single line, not aggressive

### CTA Potential Improvements (Optional):

1. Consider adding newsletter/subscription CTA if applicable
2. Consider adding GitHub links for prototype-related posts (Shopping Agent, Repo Patcher, Good Agents already have inline GitHub links)
3. Consider Twitter/X link if author has active presence

## Status: CONSISTENT

**Overall Footer Consistency: 92% (23/25 posts exactly match)**

The series demonstrates excellent footer standardization. Only 2 posts require minor updates:

1. 2025-12-repo-patcher.mdx - URL correction
2. 2025-12-research-methodology.mdx - Add standard CTA block

The remaining 23 posts are fully consistent with the established footer pattern including:

- Research series attribution with methodology summary (36 interviews, 5 conferences, 3 prototypes)
- Link to research overview
- Contact CTAs (LinkedIn + email)

No related posts suggestions are currently included in any post - this is a design decision, not an inconsistency.
