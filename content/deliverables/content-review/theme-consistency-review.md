## Recommendations

### High Priority (Should Fix)

1. **Publication 4 (Model Myth):** Add coverage of generation vs analysis asymmetry - this is a key finding in the source document that explains why coding agents succeed while other agents struggle. A paragraph addressing the 3-5x cost disadvantage for generic tasks would strengthen the post.

2. **Publication 3 (40% Rule):** Consider adding brief mention of three-database architecture (Vector + Graph + Standard DB) as a concrete implementation pattern for dual memory systems.

### Medium Priority (Consider Adding)

3. **Publication 5 (Framework Abandonment):** LiteLLM pattern for multi-provider abstraction could strengthen the "what works" section as a practical alternative to framework lock-in.

4. **Publication 6 (Enterprise Blockers):** The labor laws geographic deployment angle (a multi-agent framework company choosing Canada for easier labor laws) is a striking example that could strengthen the regulatory section.

### Low Priority (Optional)

5. **Publication 3 (40% Rule):** Explicit Type 1 vs Type 2 memory terminology could be added for completeness, though the dual memory concept is adequately covered.

6. **Publication 5 (Framework Abandonment):** Open source as enterprise acquisition strategy could be added but may dilute focus.
